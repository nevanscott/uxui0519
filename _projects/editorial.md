## Briefing

The rise of the **digital press has seen a tremendous peak** over the last years. The audience is increasing as Millennials grow older, demanding all sorts of content.

The best magazines and newspapers had already launched their digital version in early 2000, but it has been only in the last 5 years that the digital experience started to take its own shape.

With numbers increasing, publishers are prompted to **deliver quality content** along with a great digital product for readers to experience a different but still unique act of opening up a magazine and dive into it.

## Challenge

Design a high-fidelity **responsive online platform for a magazine, newspaper or blog** directed to meet the needs and goals of one of the presented User Personas (check them down below). 

You and your partner will have to deliver a **consistent, branded and engaging experience** and all the documentation that would allow the project to continue after your intervention as UI Designers.
