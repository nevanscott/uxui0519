## Briefing
Local shops often suffer a **decrease in their annual sales** due to more and more adoption in online purchases through options like Amazon or eBay. We want to help local shops **improve their online presence** to be more competitive in the market.

## Challenge
Over the next week, you’ll be **designing or re-designing a website for a local business**.

In this project, we’re focusing our efforts on delivering great shopping experiences for the end users. Because e-commerce is well-studied in the industry, we will devote the most of the research time for **benchmarking and market research** as well as developing a sense of professional best practices and rules of thumb you can always rely on. We encourage you to **visit the shop in advance to do some guerrilla research** and conduct research on client and users: observation and contextual inquiry would be the most useful methods to use in this case.

There might already be a website online, or a project for a website. Your job is then to analyze what is already there and propose a better solution for the store’s online presence.
You’ll want to inventory and audit that content to determine:

- how the content should be organized
- what content to keep, cut, or edit
- how users can navigate the site
- what’s the most important content for users

## Setup
- Teams of 3
- 5 days

## Materials
- Walls and post-its and everything in between
- Sharpies and pens and pencils
- Sketch
- Invision

## Deliverables
- Presentation
- High fidelity design or re-design of the website
- Working prototype of at least one target size

### Nice to haves (extra mile)
- Group report or Case study
- Mobile or tablet screens (responsive)

### Suggestions
- Break down the **content** of the website
- Start at **low fidelity** and work your way up
- Create **variations** of each screen to improve your odds of finding a design that works
- **Timebox** your work
- Get **feedback** early & often
- Iterate
- Build out your **presentation deck** as you go (documenting may help)
- Work fast, have fun!

### Presentation (6 minutes)
Your presentation should answer the following questions:

1. What variations on your design did your group explore?
2. How is your design improving the buying experience for customers?
3. How is your design improving the existing site being re-designed?
4. What would you do differently next time?
