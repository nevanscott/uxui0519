## Briefing

Since the 90s, **event culture has been rising tremendously**. Festivals, conferences, releases, exhibitions, and fairs have transformed into a new shape that changes every year.

**Communication is a key factor of their success.** The strategy has to be aligned and deliver a cohesive message and experience. Nowadays an **event‚Äôs digital presence is as important as the event itself** ‚Äî it represents the more lasting testimonial of what happened during those days.

At the same time, communication strategy may vary from edition to edition, **in pursuit of innovation and that wow factor**.

## Challenge

**Design a ready-to-build website for a festival of your choice** that will take place next year.

You will be working as a one-person studio and covering a series of roles to make sure you deliver a high quality project:

* Market, Trend, and User Researcher
* Interaction Designer
* Art Director
* Motion Designer
* UI Developer (we will be practicing up to dev hand-off this week)

## Scope and output

* The client is asking for a **microsite with a one-year life cycle** ‚Äî it will be stored in the main platform‚Äôs archive after this period.
* The marketing team has **defined three stages of use**: 1) Pre-event, 2) During the event, 3) Post-event
* The website **should include all the information for this edition and links for the community**. 
* **Ticket sale is a plus** ‚Äî if not possible within the scope, you can integrate a third-party service.
* The client wants to **see your work in a meeting on Friday** and all the C-Suite is invited to attend. The same day they have organised a meeting with the Dev Team to revise the documentation you‚Äôve prepared. You need to have **every asset ready by the Friday meeting**, as the front-end developer needs to start on Monday. You‚Äôll have the weekend to apply changes.
* While preparing your design hand-off (Zeplin document), remember to **follow naming conventions agreed with the team and prepare a style guide** to document everything clearly. This is key to the product‚Äôs maintenance.
