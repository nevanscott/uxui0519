## Briefing

Smart People Inc. is an educational company born in 2014. They currently offer in-person language courses — English for Spanish speakers and Spanish for English speakers — for kids from 12 to 18 years old. Their **main attraction is a summer camp**. However, **many students are unable to attend** the summer camp due to cost and time reasons, but still want to access the curriculum. Smart People Inc. **needs a way to provide an engaging online experience** for students that cannot attend the summer camp.

## Challenge

This project is about **creating an online learning platform** for 12-18 year old students. It will **transform the in-person learning experience into a 100% digital experience** that can be accessed by students at a lower cost.

## Learning Goals

* Build an MVP of a digital product, using Design Thinking
* Self-organisation: distribute the workload, keep track of versioning and consistency
* Plan and execute research to identify user personas and pain points
* Design the HCI for a complex product
* Use Sketch to build mid-fi wireframes

## Setup

* Work in pairs or alone
* 5 days

## Materials

* Walls and post-its and everything in between
* Sharpies and pens and pencils
* Sketch
* Invision

## Deliverables

* Presentation
* Mid-fidelity design of an ap
* Working prototype of at least one target size

## Nice to haves (extra mile)

* Group report or Case study
* Complete and annotated “wireflow” (include gestures and transitions)
* One high-fidelity screen
* Mobile or tablet screens (responsive)

## Suggestions

To start thinking about the problem, try to answer these questions:

* Why would kids use an online learning platform?
* What type of experience do they expect?
* What type of engagement do they expect?
* What is their level of technology knowledge?
* Do kids want to study in summer or do they want to have fun while studying?
* How can we make kids keep the pace, learn and engage while learning?
* What is the problem that you’re trying to solve for your users?
* What are your users’ goals?
* What are your product’s goals? How do you want someone to feel while experiencing it?
* What are the product requirements of your design solution?

## Presentation (6 minutes)

Your presentation should answer the following questions:

1. What was the process behind your design and how did it evolve?
2. How does your research insights translate into a solution you propose?
3. How does your design provide equivalent experience to the in-person one during summer camps?
4. What were your key learnings and what would be the next steps?
