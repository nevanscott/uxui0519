## Briefing

Fun People Inc. is an educational company born in 2014. They currently offer **in-person courses for adults of: languages, music, yoga, cooking and first-aid**. Their main attraction are workshop camps. Dozens of people **join every month the workshops in different locations**, as the school has a very special recipe: they integrate classes, outdoor activities, technology, humour, games, and other cool stuff to their mission of teaching people additional skills.

However, many people **are unable to attend** the workshop camp due to time and cost reasons, but still want to take part in a course. Fun People Inc. **needs a way to provide an engaging online experience** for people who cannot attend the workshop camp.

## The Workshop Camp

* Each workshop camp lasts two weeks
* A course has around 10 activities and 10 lessons
* Out of these activities and lessons, students get to decide which 5 they want to take
* If they are willing to join more sessions, they can be put in the waiting list
* All attendees receive feedback from other students and their coaches
* Coaches follow student progress, in order to effectively asses them and be able to co-create the most adequate learning path together
* Fun People Inc. has a lot of material in the various formats already developed after years of running the workshops and school

## Challenge

This project is about **creating an online learning platform that will transform the in-person learning experience into a 100% digital experience**, so people with less time and financial resources can join.

## Learning Goals

* Build an MVP of a digital product, using Design Thinking
* Self-organisation: distribute the workload, keep track of versioning and consistency, prioritisation
* Plan and execute research to identify user personas and pain points
* Design the HCI for a complex product
* Use Sketch to build the interface

## Setup

* Work individually
* 5 days

## Materials

* Walls and post-its and everything in between
* Sharpies and pens and pencils
* Sketch
* Invision

## Deliverables

* Presentation
* Mid-fidelity wireframes
* Working prototype of at least 1 viewport size
* Minimum 1 high-fidelity screen 
* Case study

## Nice to haves (extra mile)

* Complete an annotated “wireflow” (include gestures and transitions)
* Secondary screens for another viewport (desktop/tablet/mobile)

## Suggestions

To start thinking about the problem, try to answer these questions:

* What would motivate people to use an online learning platform?
* What type of experience do they expect?
* What type of engagement do they expect?
* What is their level of technology knowledge?
* How can we make people keep the pace, learn and engage while learning online?
* What is the problem that you’re trying to solve for your users?
* What are your users’ goals?
* What are your product’s goals? How do you want someone to feel while experiencing it?
* What are the product requirements of your design solution?

## Presentation (6 minutes)

Your presentation should answer the following questions:

1. What was the process behind your design and how did it evolve?
2. How does your research insights translate into a solution you propose?
3. How does your design provide equivalent experience to the in-person one during summer camps?
4. What were your key learnings and what are the next steps?

## Uploads

**Once your presentation is done and shiny, make sure you upload it** [**here**](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1GAuXd0EeILC4DQ7QSeoV_7QTc4CWoVWJ)**.**
