## Briefing
Design has been defined as **"the conception and planning of the artificial".**

Different definitions of design (graphic design, architecture, product design, etc.), are variations of this broad theme, each a concrete exploration of a possible reality in our world.

The problems addressed by designers seldom fall solely within the boundaries of any concrete discipline. The wicked problems approach is an alternative to linear thinking.

Most of the problems addressed by designers are **wicked problems:**

“… a class of social system problems which are ill-formulated, where the information is confusing, where there are many clients and decision makers with conflicting values, and where the ramifications in the whole system are thoroughly confusing.”


## Challenge
During this project, you’ll be addressing wicked problems that many people experience throughout their lives, just by living in a modern city.

The goal is not that you present a finished and polished prototype by the end of the week. We want you to focus on isolating, researching and understanding a more precise, granular and specific problem from the given list. Your outcome will be an overview of the solution: a first attempt to organize requirements, actors, and resources with technology to improve peoples experience.
