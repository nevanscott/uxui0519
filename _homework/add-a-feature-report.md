Write a report about your [Add a Feature](https://uxui0519.netlify.com/projects/add-a-feature/) Project. This may be similar to a written version of your presentation, but youâ€™ll have the opportunity to go into more detail.

Next week, bring this with you to your 1-on-1 with one of the TAs, to review the project with them.

**Use these suggestions as a guide to write your report:**
