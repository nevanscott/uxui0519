Go back to the website you used for the ‘Responsive Website Part 1’ homework. The aim of this second part is to understand design systems and style tiles.

**Upload your final Sketch files to the Google Drive in the “Completed Work” folder.**

## Deliverable:

It is **HIGHLY** recommended that you use symbols for this exercise, so that you don’t spend infinite amount of time on it.

**Deliverable Instructions**

1. Looking at the website and at examples of design systems, reverse engineer the style tile that has been used to create this website
2. More advanced (opcional): Use nested symbols to make the beginning of a design system for the site
3. Upload your Sketch file to the Google Drive in the “Completed Work” folder.
