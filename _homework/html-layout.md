## Assignment

Write the HTML of at **least one of the pages** you designed last week for your curated event micro-site. We strongly encourage you to write up to three pages of HTML, that way you will be able to learn and practice how to link among pages.

## Deliverable

Please, when your document(s) is (are) done, upload them to [**your assigned folder in Google Drive**](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/18iE18x2tlfTWrRXZ4Pon8bgnTQS_kT_M). We'll review them **Tuesday morning** and give it back to you so you can work with the CSS.
