## Learning Goals

* Develop your eye for details
* Create a complete high fidelity mobile screen
* Understand the importance of good UI Design
* Understand hoy to organize UI elements in a user interface

## Briefing

In order to level up your skills in UI Design, we are going to kick off with a basic exercise. You will be **designing a mobile screen for a music app** in which the user can:

1. See the name of the artist/song being played
2. Stop/Play & favorite the song
3. Search other songs/artists
4. Have access to favorite songs
5. See some recommendations of playlists
6. See recently played playlists

### Suggestions:

1. If you want, look for **inspiration** in sites like [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) or [Behance](https://www.behance.net) (but don't copy!)
2. Start by creating **low fidelity** paper prototypes and move on to mid fidelity, and so on
3. Use variations of the colors given in the **UI Kit**

## Deliverable

Deliver **one high-fidelity mobile screen**. Upload your Sketch files [to the Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1QLqA2QX0qLOx5pBGMswIe3D8JTARs5_l) in the "Completed work" folder.
